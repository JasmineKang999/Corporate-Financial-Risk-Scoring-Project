# Corporate-Financial-Risk-Scoring-Project
This project aims to assess the financial risk of listed companies based on their financial statements using a multi-dimensional scoring approach. It calculates a risk score for each company by combining balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow data, without requiring prior knowledge of industry classification.
